## Setup
How to configure:
1. ```git clone``` the project.
2. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create a new application.
3. Create a new bot for your user and copy the token.
4. Create a new file in your repository called ```config.ts```.
5. Run ```npm i``` in the project folder.
6. Now by using ```npm start``` your bot will startup, the only thing for you to do is add it to a Discord server!

# SomeoneDiscordBot
Allows you to ping the bot inside of discord which will reply with a randomly pinged person in that server.
By naming the bot 'someone' you can use @someone inside of Discord to ping a random person.
